# perceptron-classifier
simple classifier with perceptron (university assignment)

In this project, the goal is to implement a classifier to predict if a passenger
is satisfied with his travel services or not

in firts phase, perceptron classifier used for prediction
the final result score is 83%

in second phase, we test RBFSampler & PolynomialCountSketch kernels for mapping dataset to new feature space, to 
see if it helps us to get higher score or not.

RBF score: 86%

polynomial score: 92%
